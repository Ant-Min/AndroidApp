# AndroidApp

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The project was to create an app where the user can keep track of events they enter. In general, there should be a log in with the user's events being on accessible on any device. They can add and delete events can get notifications or a text message when an event is happening that day.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

There were a few screens that were necessary. The first was the log in screen, the second was the screen that displayed all events, the third would be clicking on an event to expand for more detail, and the final screen would eb the screen to add a new event. The UI designs were kept simple and easy to read to allow users to quickly understand the app. I was mostly successful with the screens, but I had a setback trying to add buttons on the events page, so the user clicks on any event to get to the add event page.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I approached it like any coding project where I test as I code. I also coded this project "in order" of screens the user would come across to be able ot access each screen as I tested. This has been my strategy for any project I've done, and it has helped me thus far.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Whenever I finished coding a page in the app I would test to make sure functionality for all of the values were correct before I tested a button that would go to a different class. Testing is important to make sure the code works properly.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I ended up using a legacy layout to create the vision I had in my head for my app. I think however this impeded me in the overall creation of my app and would probably to think to reinnovate in the future.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I think I was successful with the general understanding of making text based apps. There are areas that I can improve on, but overall, I feel I have a basic understandign of what it takes to make an app.
